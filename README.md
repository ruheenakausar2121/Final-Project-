# Final-Project-Vaultofcode Internship
# Personal To-Do List Application

A simple **Personal To-Do List Application** built with **Python**, focusing on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **file handling**. This project allows users to **create, view, edit, and delete tasks**, while saving progress locally using a JSON file.

---

## Features

- **Task Management**
  - Add tasks with a title, description, and category.
  - Mark tasks as completed.
  - Delete tasks.

- **Categorization**
  - Organize tasks into categories like Work, Personal, Urgent, Shopping, or Other.

- **Persistence**
  - Tasks are saved to a local `tasks.json` file, so your data is retained between sessions.

- **User-Friendly CLI**
  - Simple command-line interface with clear menus and prompts.

---

## Key Concepts Used

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Task class with attributes and methods.
- **File Handling**: Saving and loading tasks using JSON serialization.
- **Dictionary Unpacking**: Loading JSON data directly into Task objects.

---

## Installation

1. Make sure **Python 3.x** is installed.
2. Clone this repository or download the files to your local machine.
3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
Activate the virtual environment:

PowerShell:

powershell
Copy code
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
CMD:

If you want, I can also **create a ready-to-use PowerPoint (10–15 slides)** based on this README, showing:  

- Project overview  
- Features  
- Sample outputs  
- Technical highlights  

It will be **presentation-ready** for submission.  

Do you want me to do that?
